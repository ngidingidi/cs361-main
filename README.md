This assignment has three parts:

●	Part 1: Environment Setup. Initialize your GitHub repository and set up GitHub Projects for organizing your project tasks.

●	Part 2: Course Project Plan. Write all the user stories you would like to be part of your course project (except for the microservice you’ll later make for a teammate). It’s OK if you don’t implement all of them this term, and you will likely need to write additional stories later in the term.

●	Part 3: Sprint 1 Plan. Select at least three user stories to implement during Sprint 1 (for your Main Program / Milestone #1). Define detailed requirements for each user story.
